# STARTPLATZ_Hackathon
Test repository for the STARTPLATZ Hackathon November 21st 2025

Nothing in here should be trusted, it is an experimental space for me to get started in this Hackathon. 
I'm a product person, not a software engineer. None of my code will likely be safe to use. 

I'm using this to experiment and learn, it's about learning more about the world of coding and vibe coding.
To see what works, what does not work from a beginner's perspective.
